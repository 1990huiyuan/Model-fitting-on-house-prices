This is a Kaggle challenge to fit regression models to house prices in Ames, Iowa using R. 

The data can be viewed and downloaded here:https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques

This work focues on regression and classoification model fitting using R to predict house price.

Firstly, several regression models are built with dimention reduction, and then the house price are categoried as "expensive, cannot afford" and "ok, can afford" with the threthod as medium. Classification model (XGBoosts) is built to predict the house price category.
